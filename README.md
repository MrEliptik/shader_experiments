As I'm trying to learn shaders with Godot, I'm sharing them here for the community to use! You can also find most of them on [Godot shaders](https://godotshaders.com/author/mreliptik/)

If you want more Godot experiments, checkout my [Godot experiments](https://github.com/MrEliptik/godot_experiments).

## Structure

Every shader has its own folder with everything needed inside. 

This will probably duplicate some assets, but at least you know that if you want a particular shader, you can just copy its folder.
